I just completed a hands-on Windows Server 2019 lab — built a full Active Directory domain test.local from scratch and recorded a short demo of the final setup.

Here’s what I implemented:
🔹 Created OUs: HR, Sales, IT
🔹 Users:
 • HR: Belal Wael, Salma Mohamed
 • Sales: Alaa Ali
 • IT: Ahmed Nabil
🔹 Security groups for each department
🔹 Client machine (PC-01) joined to the domain
🔹 Group Policies applied:
 • Disabled Control Panel for HR & Sales
 • Blocked external storage for HR
 • Removed Task Manager for everyone except IT
 • Enforced password & lockout policies
 • Disabled CMD & Run for HR & Sales
 • Added custom HR shortcut
 • Allowed ping across all computers through firewall GPO
 • IT-Group added as local admins on all PCs
 • Local admin account (itadmin) created via GPO

💡 Watch the demo video to see all these configurations in action
